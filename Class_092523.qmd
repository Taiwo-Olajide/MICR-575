```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
Eagle_data <- read.csv("fake_eagle_nest_counts.csv")
glimpse(Eagle_data)
```

I think the data is not tidy. The columns represented the year, locations that the readings were taken that could be collapsed to form the regions which they are observations for.

```{r message=FALSE}
Eagle_data |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = pacific:rocky.mtn,
               names_to = "region", 
               values_to = "value")

```


```{r message=FALSE}
Eagle_table <- Eagle_data |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = pacific:rocky.mtn,
               names_to = "region", 
               values_to = "value")
Eagle_table |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = value, group = region)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

```
