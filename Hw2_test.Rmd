# Taiwo Olajide Homework 2

## 1. What were the main issues in the Reinhard and Rogoff issue, and how best could they have been avoided?

Professors Reinhard and Rogoff omitted some data in their calculation for the GDP to debt threshold determinant for economic growth. They omitted data from 5 countries in the total of twenty countries that they were using for the calculation. Based on their repute as the some of the best economists in the world at the time. Politicians and policy makers all over the world were using their result in formulation of policies and campaign manifestos. This lead to decisions based on incorrect premise. This had gone on for three years before another group came out to dispel their results, showing that they had committed an omission in their previous calculation. In my opinion, this issue would have been totally avoided if the following had been done.

1.  If the authors has built in a quality control check into their data analysis pipeline. This would have shown that the data they were getting have veered away from the ballpark figures that would have naturally being expected in the analysis they were doing.

2.  If the duo of the professors have make their data and analysis codes available for the public at the point of the issuing of the white paper. Interested groups would have gone through the calculations independently and would have caught the mistake early enough and the error wouldn't have been around for a whole three years

3.  The publishers should have on their own done their due diligence to ensure that the results published are reproducible.

## 2. What key attributes make a piece of data analysis "reproducible"? Please put those attributes in a prioritized list (i.e., for you, what is most important, nextÂ  most important, etc\...)

    1.  The analysis should yield the same results when the data is put through another analysis pipeline aimed at giving same results.

    2.  The codes must be explicitly clear for another person ton understand

## 3. Imagine that you are doing a piece of data analysis that only you will ever see: perhaps you are shopping for a car and trying to determine what will give you the best value for your money. Should you think about making your data analysis reproducible? Why or why not?

        Data analysis should always be reproducible. More often than not, there has been reasons for people to revisit their the thought process for the decisions that they make. This is either to get reassurance that they made the right decision or if theirs a need to amend the decision. Having a reproducible data analysis makes it easier to understand what led to the decision ab initio.
